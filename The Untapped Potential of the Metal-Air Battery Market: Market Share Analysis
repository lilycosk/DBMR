Market Analysis and Insights:

Global Metal-Air Battery Market

Metal-air battery market will reach at an estimated value of USD 1,240.69 million and grow at a CAGR of 13.90% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Growing demand for high-energy-density storage solutions and inherent properties of metal-air batteries is an essential factor driving the metal-air battery market.

Metal air batteries are the type of batteries that are designed to offer features of conventional as well as fuel cell properties. These batteries consist of cathode, anode, and electrolyte. Metal air batteries consist of metal anodes and porous cathode such as lithium, sodium, zinc, and others. Metal air batteries offer 3-30 times higher energy density as compared to Li-ion batteries, thus making it an alternative in electric vehicles.

Increasing use of zinc-air batteries in electronic devices, especially in hearing aids is a crucial factor accelerating the market growth, also rising shift toward green-energy sources, increasing acceptance of green energy sources, growing demand for storage solutions with high energy density, rising need for zinc-air batteries, increased the demand for metal air batteries for increasing the capacity of energy storage of batteries which turn helps to increase the range, increasing technological advancements have been developed in order to recycle these batteries and rising demand for high-capacity, safe, cost-effective, and eco-friendly energy storage solutions and it can also be used in hearing devices, watches, and stationary energy storage applications are the major factors among others boosting the metal air battery market. Moreover, rising newer applications of metal-air batteries apart from electric vehicles and rising substantial growth in demand for electric vehicles will further create new opportunities for metal air battery market in the forecast period mentioned above.

However, rising absence of proper standards for developing metal-air batteries and rising corrosion between electrolyte and anode in zinc-air batteries are the major factors among others which will curtail the market growth, while rising rapid discharging of aluminium-air and magnesium-air batteries will further challenge the metal air battery market in the forecast period mentioned above.
