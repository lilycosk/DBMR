Market Analysis and Insights :

Global Network Emulator Market

The network emulator market is expected to witness market growth at a rate of 8.05% in the forecast period of 2021 to 2028. Data Bridge Market Research report on the network emulator market provides analysis and insights regarding the various factors expected to be prevalent throughout the forecast period while providing their impacts on the market's growth. The rise in the demand to test different network applications is escalating the growth of the network emulator market.

Network emulation is known to be a practice that tests the performance of several applications in real-time through virtual network tools. Network emulation is utilized by application developers, service providers, and manufacturers to confirm the strength of a network product or application. The standard functionality of network emulators comprises impairments, modifiers filtering, and routing. These emulations are different from network simulations as emulations represent mathematical models of channels, network models, protocols, and traffic that is applied to a network.

Major factors that are expected to boost the growth of the network emulator market in the forecast period are the increase in attacks and security breaches on networks and the demand for reduced downtime in networking. Furthermore, the rise in the acceptance of IoT devices and the relocation of enterprises towards cloud-based infrastructure is further anticipated to propel the growth of the network emulator market. Moreover, the growing acceptance of SD-WAN technology solutions is further estimated to cushion the growth of the network emulator market. On the other hand, the
longer timelines and extended research and development needs for the new networking technologies and price sensitivity of network testing and emulators are further projected to impede the growth of the network emulator market in the timeline period.

In addition, the rise in the need for software-defined networking and virtualization will further provide potential opportunities for the growth of the network emulator market in the coming years. However, the dearth of a skilled workforce to comprehend and report issues in networking might further challenge the growth of the network emulator market in the near future
