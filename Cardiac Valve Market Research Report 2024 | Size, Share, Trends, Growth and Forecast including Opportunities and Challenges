Market Analysis and Size

The cardiac valve is a tiny hole in the heart chamber that controls the flow of heat. A cardiac valve is a one-way valve that is implanted into the heart of a patient to replace a defective native heart valve. It is a device that is used by patients who have heart problems. The heart valve ensures that blood flows in the proper direction and at the appropriate pressure. The valve's primary role is to keep blood flowing in one direction through the heart and from the heart to other regions of the body that require blood flow.
