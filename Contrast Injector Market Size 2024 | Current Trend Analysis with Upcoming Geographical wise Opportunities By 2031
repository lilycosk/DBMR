Market Analysis and Size

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2021, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Cardiovascular disease affects an estimated 17.9 million people each year. Strokes and heart attacks cause four out of every five cardiovascular deaths, and one-third of deaths occur in people under 70. The majority of businesses are developing novel products to reduce contrast media waste and gain a competitive advantage. Bracco has developed smart syringeless injectors that can maximise efficiency by using every drop of contrast loaded into the system.
